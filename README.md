# Minesweeper Game Boy Style ðŸ•¹

A retro-themed **Minesweeper** game built in **Java**, inspired by the classic aesthetics of the **Game Boy**. This project combines the classic gameplay of Minesweeper with the nostalgic look and feel of an 8-bit era.

  - **Pixel Art Graphics**: Cells, mines, and numbers are rendered in pixel art for an authentic 8-bit experience.
  - **Retro Font**: The text and UI elements use a pixelated font that mirrors old-school Game Boy games.

- **Classic Minesweeper Gameplay**:
  - **Game Board**: A grid-based board where you reveal cells, avoiding mines.
